## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SaaS stylesheet language
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Thanks to this project I've practised in using SaaS to build more structured CSS files with proper cascading which makes development process easier. Learned to use named variables for style's properties on a separate file, which is then imported in the main CSS file. 


### Continued development

Looking forward to practise more with SaaS especially to use functions, modules and mixins
